# Examples of BUGS programs and their associated DAG diagrams.

* __WinBUGS_help_examples.pdf__: These are the examples from the help tab of WinBUGS. I printed each example to a PDF file, then merged them into one large file. Most (but not all) contain DAG diagrams.

* __bugs_examples.rmd, bugs_examples.html__: Simple examples of statistical analysis using JAGS. The first just estimates the mean and standard deviation of a set of measurements, followed by the three examples from the article [Linear regression models using Bayesian analysis in JAGS](https://biometry.github.io/APES//LectureNotes/StatsCafe/Linear_models_jags.html), of increasing complexity.

* __parsed_graph_examples.Rmd__: Examples where I have pulled the variables from BUGS programs to make tables of nodes and edges.
